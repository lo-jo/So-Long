# So long
2D arcade game in C that uses the floodfill algorithm and pathfinding techniques to navigate the game environment.\
The playerâ€™s goal is to collect all collectibles present on the map then be able to escape.

This project was created using 42's graphic library and my own custom pixel art textures.
